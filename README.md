# Higher-Education-Compass
Developed a web application assisting Malaysian high school students in choosing university programs based on their personalities, interests, values, and abilities, using HTML/JS/CSS, Bootstrap, Laravel, PHP and MySQL.

Features include:
- Holland career assessment tool to identify students' personalities, interests, values, and abilities.
- Personalized interpretations, university programme recommendations, and career suggestions based on assessment results.
- Entrepreneurial assessment to identify students' potential to become entrepreneurs.
- Information about occupations, industry, and the Malaysian labour market.

The system aims to improve students' self-awareness, facilitate informed decision-making, and promote better academic and career choices. It has the potential to reduce dropout rates, regret on university program choice, and unemployment rates by providing valuable career guidance resources.
